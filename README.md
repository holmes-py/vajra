## About Vajra
![logo](https://github.com/r3curs1v3-pr0xy/vajra/blob/main/images/home.png)<br>

Vajra is an automated web hacking framework to automate boring recon tasks and same scans for multiple target during web applications penetration testing. Vajra has highly customizable target scope based scan feature. Instead of running all the scan on target, it runs only those scan selected by you which will minimize unnecessary traffic and stores output in one place at CouchDB.

Vajra uses most common open source tools which every Bug Hunter runs during their testing on target. It does all the stuffs through web browser with very simple UI that makes it absolute beginner friendly framework. 

Analyzing your data from scan result is very important in Bug Bounty. The chances of missing anything is less only if you could visualize your data in proper way and Vajra does so with a lot of filters.

I created this project for my personal use (about 6 months ago)  but looking at its usefulness, I decided to make it open-source so that it can save your time and can get some more improvement from community.

#### Currently, I added only 27 unique bug bounty feature to it but more will be added in near future.

## FAQ

- #### What is the accuracy of this framework?<br>
=> Vajra uses only open source tools and scripts so its accuracy depends upon those tools.
- #### What is scalability of this framework?<br>
=> It depends upon the resources you provide to run it.
- #### Does it gives immediate result?<br>
-=> Although Vajra uses asynchronous methods but still it takes some time to complete all the scan. You can see your running scans through ongoing scan tab
